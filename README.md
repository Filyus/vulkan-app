## Dependencies

- `ash` - Vulkan bindings for Rust
- `winit` - Window creation and event handling
- `cgmath` - Math utilities for 3D graphics
- `raw-window-handle` - Window handle abstraction
- `bytemuck` - Safe memory casting for vertex data
- `legion` - Entity Component System framework
- `log` - Logging framework
- `fern` - Logging implementation
- `chrono` - Time utilities for logging
- `imgui` - Immediate mode GUI library
- `imgui-winit-support` - Winit integration for ImGui
- `imgui-glow-renderer` - OpenGL renderer for ImGui (fallback)

## Configuration

The application uses a comprehensive configuration system located in `src/config.rs`:

- **Window Settings**: Default size (800x600), title, minimum dimensions
- **Vulkan Settings**: API version, validation layers, device extensions
- **Rendering Settings**: Clear color, culling, rasterization parameters
- **Debug Settings**: Logging levels, validation, performance monitoring
- **ECS Settings**: Entity limits, system profiling
- **Shader Settings**: Shader paths and entry points
- **Memory Settings**: Buffer alignment and allocation strategies

## Error Handling

The application features robust error handling with the `AppError` enum that covers:
- Vulkan-specific errors (instance, device, swapchain, pipeline creation)
- Window-related errors (creation, event handling)
- ECS errors (world initialization, system execution)
- I/O errors and generic application errors

## Debug Features

- **Validation Layers**: Automatic enablement in debug builds
- **Debug Messenger**: Comprehensive Vulkan validation output
- **Logging**: Structured logging with configurable levels
- **Performance Monitoring**: Frame time tracking and system profiling
- **Memory Tracking**: Debug utilities for memory management

## Building for Release

For optimized release builds:

```bash
cargo build --release
```

## Runtime Shader Compilation

This application features advanced runtime shader compilation that automatically compiles GLSL shaders to SPIR-V bytecode during application startup, eliminating the need for manual shader compilation steps.

### Features

- **Automatic Compilation**: Shaders are compiled automatically when the application starts
- **Shader Caching**: Compiled shaders are cached in memory for faster subsequent compilations
- **Debug Support**: Debug information is automatically included in debug builds
- **Optimization**: Performance optimization levels are applied in release builds
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error reporting for shader compilation failures
- **Preloading**: Common shaders are preloaded during startup for faster initialization

### Shader Configuration

The shader compilation system is configured through `src/config.rs`:

- **Shader Cache**: Enabled by default for faster compilation
- **Debug Info**: Automatically enabled in debug builds
- **Optimization**: Performance optimization in release, zero optimization in debug
- **Preloading**: Common shaders are preloaded during startup

### Shader Files

- **sdf.vert**: Vertex shader for fullscreen quad rendering
- **sdf.frag**: Fragment shader implementing SDF ray marching with proper aspect ratio handling
- **imgui.vert**: ImGui vertex shader for UI rendering
- **imgui.frag**: ImGui fragment shader for UI rendering

The shaders include:
- Proper aspect ratio correction to prevent stretching during window resize
- Push constants for dynamic window data (resolution, time, aspect ratio)
- SDF ray marching implementation with multiple shape support
- Phong lighting model with shadows
- ImGui integration for UI rendering

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter build errors:

1. **Vulkan SDK**: Ensure the Vulkan SDK is properly installed and the `VULKAN_SDK` environment variable is set (required for Ash Vulkan bindings)
2. **Build Tools**: Make sure you have the Visual Studio Build Tools installed (on Windows)
3. **ShaderC**: The shaderc library is used for runtime shader compilation and is included as a dependency (no manual shader compilation needed)
4. **Clean Build**: Try running `cargo clean` and then `cargo build` to force a clean rebuild

If the app fails to run with validation layer errors, it will automatically fall back to running without validation layers.
